            <p>Plants bring natural beauty to our living spaces. By creating texture and balance, a room or patio can be transformed into an environment that comforts and welcomes. But, just like Miss Universe, plants can do more than look pretty. They’ve been proven to reduce stress so well that one glance at a plant lowers your heart rate. They also help clean the air we breathe by absorbing toxins and acting as little oxygen factories. Plants simply make us feel better.

                By easing mental fatigue and improving air quality plants manage to find themselves an indispensable part of your home life. Not convinced yet? Studies show that:

                <p>1. In addition to calming your heart rate, plants lower blood pressure and reduce muscle tension related to stress</p>
                <p>2. Plants help us relax and focus, leading to increased productivity, creativity, idea generation, and problem solving capabilities. In fact, the presence of plants helps so much that it has been shown to relieve the symptoms experienced by children with ADD.</p>
                <p>3. Plants help patients recovering from surgery and ease the symptoms of Alzheimer’s.</p>

            <h2># Be More Afraid of Overwatering Than Underwatering</h2>
            <p>Some signs you might be overwatering:</p>
            <p>1. Young and old leaves fall at the same time.</p>
            <p>2. Root rot: mushy, brown, possibly odorous roots are in pot bottom.</p>
            <p>3. Standing water hanging in container underliner.</p>
            <p>4. Flowers become moldy.</p>
            <p>5. Leaves develop brown soft rotten patches and fail to grow.</p>
            
            <h2># Feed Them Coffee and Egg Shells</h2>
            <p>Try mixing coffee grounds or egg shells into the soil. Yup. Garbage. Store-bought potting soil has all the nutrients your plants need, but about once a year, calcium-rich egg shells can give plants a great boost (do it too often and you'll change the soil's pH balance). Clean off the icky stuff, let them sit out to dry, and then crush them to a coarse powder. Pour that around the base of the plants, and water.</p>
            <p>Coffee grounds have nitrogen — yummy for plants. Different plants like a different amount of coffee, just like humans. To get a sense of how much to use, start with a teaspoon a week mixed into the soil, and then increase the amount until your plants stop showing signs of improvement. Then it should be good to go for a while.</p>

            <h2># Go Easy on the Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Dilute your plant food. Too much fertilizer is worse than no fertilizer at all. “Fertilizers contain salts, which can build up in the soil," Feldstein says. “It will burn the roots, and the tips of your plant leaves will go brown. Dilute the plant food one-half to one-quarter the recommended strength."</p>

            <h2># Give Plants a Haircut</h2>
            <p>You know that light, airy feeling you have after a haircut? Your plants love it, too. Just because your spider plant is long enough to ring the room doesn't mean it's healthy. Pruning houseplants helps them grow stronger and more lush.</p>
            <p>Prune away dead leaves, limbs and flowers at the beginning of the growing season or after the plant has flowered. While there are a few plants that don't need pruning, most are happier when they're all spruced up.</p>

            <h2># Know When to Repot</h2>
            <p>Sometimes your plants will get too big for their clay britches. When that happens, it's time to repot.</p>
            <p>To find out if your little one is ready to graduate, gently remove it from its pot. "If the roots have taken on the shape of the pot, it's time to move to a larger pot," Feldstein says. The new container should be about two inches wider and a couple of inches deeper than the old pot.</p>
            <p>"Then, don't feed the plant [with fertilizer] for at least six weeks after repotting so it has time to acclimate. And, remember that now that the pot is larger it'll take longer for the soil to dry and you won't have to water as often."</p>
